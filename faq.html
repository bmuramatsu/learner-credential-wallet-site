                      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"><a name="lcw" />What is the Learner Credential Wallet?</h2>
                      <p class="p-small">The Learner Credential Wallet is an <a href="https://github.com/digitalcredentials/learner-credential-wallet">open source</a> mobile wallet developed by the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu">Digital Credentials Consortium</a>, a network of leading international universities designing an open infrastructure for academic credentials.</p>

                      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"><a name="lcw-pilot" />What is the Learner Credential Wallet Pilot?</h2>
                      <p class="p-small">Please read about the <a href="pilot.html">Learner Credential Wallet Pilot.</a></p>
                    
                      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"><a name="public-link" />What happens when I "Create Public Link"?</h2>
                      <p class="p-small">Creating a Public Link is a voluntary process. We provide this functionality for if you would like to be able to share a credential from your wallet to anyone with the link.</p>
                      <p class="p-small">Creating a public link will generate a webpage to display the contents of a credential on the <a href=”https://verifierpluss.app/”>VerifierPlus</a> website managed by the <a href=”https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/”>Digital Credentials Consortium<a>. You are fully in control of how and with whom you share this link.</p>
                        <p class="p-small">The Public Link is governed by the <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> and <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"><a name="public-link-more" />What can others do with a “Public Link”?</h2>
                      <p class="p-small">Anyone with the link will be able to view the credential that is shared via a "Public Link". We recommend you consider where, to whom and how frequently you share a “Public Link”.
</p>

                      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"><a name="public-link-unshare" />I want to stop sharing a “Public Link”, how do I do so?</h2>
                      <p class="p-small">You manage “Public Links” from individual credentials in Learner Credential Wallet. Navigate to the credential with a “Public Link”. Select the three dot menu in the upper right hand portion of the screen. Select “Share” and then select “Unshare”. After confirming you want to unshare the link, the link will be removed from VerifierPlus and no longer be viewable. We will remove the details of the credential but will retain the ability for you to choose to “Create Public Link” again in the future and use the same web address.</p>

                      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"><a name="add-to-linkedin" />What is “Add to LinkedIn Profile”?</h2>
                      <p class="p-small">You may want to share your credential on your LinkedIn Profile. We provide a shortcut to help you do so. Adding a credential to your LinkedIn Profile from Learner Credential Wallet also requires you to “Create Public Link” as that will allow visitors to your LinkedIn Profile to view the credential.</p>
                        <p class="p-small">Note: Before you can add a Public Link created through the Learner Credential Wallet to your LinkedIn Profile, you must:
                        <ul><li>Have the LinkedIn app installed on your device.</li>
                          <li>Be logged in to your LinkedIn profile.</li>
                          <li>Either have already created a public link or create one simultaneously with adding to your LinkedIn Profile.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>

                      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"><a name="add-to-linkedin-not-working" />I’ve tried “Add to LinkedIn Profile” and it’s not working.</h2>
                      <p class="p-small">Here are a set of troubleshooting steps to follow:
                        <ul><li>If you just logged in to the LinkedIn App, try “Add to LinkedIn Profile” again.</li>
                          <li>Make sure the LinkedIn app is installed on your device.</li>
                          <li>Make sure you’re logged in to your LinkedIn profile.</li>
                          <li>Make sure you’re online and your device has network connectivity.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>

                      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Who do I contact if I have more questions?</h2>
